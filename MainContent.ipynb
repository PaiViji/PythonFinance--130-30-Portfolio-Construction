    "DE HOF is a population based metaheuristic strategy that can efficiently solve complex constrained optimization problems. We restrict the discussion to the DE HOF designed to solve the 130-30 portfolio optimization problem model. The input, process and output of the DE HOF strategy are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inputs \n",
    "\n",
    "It is essential that the *portfolio parameters* and the *DE HOF strategy parameters* are clearly set before the optimization process begins. \n",
    "\n",
    "The portfolio parameters are (1) assets in the portfolio (2) asset betas (3) mean asset returns (4) covariance of returns (the variance-covariance matrix of returns) and (5) risk free rate of return.\n",
    "\n",
    "The DE HOF parameters are (1) population size (2) number of generations (3) dynamic penalty function parameters $(C, \\alpha, \\beta)$ (4) Scale factor $\\beta_S$  and (5) probability of recombination $p_r$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Process\n",
    "\n",
    "DE HOF begins its execution by generating an *initial random population of individuals* that represent the candidate solution sets to the optimization problem concerned. Each individual in the population represents a collection of N *genes* that represent random weights generated in the range [-0.3, 1.3] for the N assets in the portfolio. \n",
    "\n",
    "The candidate solution sets are transformed into feasible solution sets by calling the weight repair strategies which repair each individual in the population, so that it satisfies constraints represented by equations [1.2] to [1.5]. At the end of the process the initial population is transformed into a population that is a feasible solution set and is termed as the *parent population* \n",
    "\n",
    "Typical of metaheuristic strategies, DE HOF now computes the *fitness function values* of each individual in the parent population making use of the penalized objective function described by equations [1.7]-[1.8].\n",
    "\n",
    "Making use of mutation and crossover operators ( *Rand4/Best/Dir5 mutation operator* and *Binomial Crossover operator*) and the scale factor $\\beta_A$, DE HOF generates what are called *trial vectors* which eventually leads to the production of  the *offspring population* of individuals. (See [FEO 2006] to know more about Rand4/Best/Dir5 operator)\n",
    "\n",
    "The offspring population of individuals is standardized to satisfy the respective constraints, by calling the weight repair strategies once again and their fitness function values are computed as was done for the parent population.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the fitness function values of the individuals in  the parent population and offspring population, the best fit individuals are selected using the *Deterministic Selection operator* and pushed to the next generation. The best among the better individuals selected for the next generation with maximal fitness function value and zero penalty function value (no constraints violated) is inducted into the *Hall of Fame*. \n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of the first generation, the next generation pool of individuals get set as the parent population and the second generation begins. The second generation offspring population is now generated by repeating the reproduction process and the best among the better individuals selected for the third generation competes with the individual in the Hall of Fame. DE HOF ensures that only the best individual by way of maximal fitness function value and zero penalty function value generated this far, is inducted into the Hall of Fame. \n",
    "\n",
    "The generation cycles progress  until the termination criterion is met with, at which stage the individual in the Hall of Fame is declared to be the optimal solution to the problem concerned. Since it is integrated optimization,  those positions that are to be longed or shorted to arrive at the optimal 130-30 portfolio,  is known only at this stage.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output\n",
    "\n",
    "The genes of the HOF individual represent the optimal weights or proportion of capital to be invested in the assets of the portfolio.  Positive weights indicate assets that are to be longed and negative weights indicate assets that are to be shorted. Given the mean returns and the covariance of returns, the risk and return of the optimal 130-30 portfolio can be easily computed. It can be verified that all the long and short positions in the optimal portfolio satisfy their respective budgets and leveraged bounds constraints and the portfolio beta equals 1, ensuring that the volatility of the optimal 130-30 portfolio matches that of  the market.\n",
